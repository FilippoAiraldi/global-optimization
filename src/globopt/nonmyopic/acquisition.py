    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array of shape (n_samples, horizon, n_var)
        Array of trajectories for which to compute the acquisition function. `n_samples`
        is the number of units processed in parallel, `horizon` is the horizon length of
        the trajectories, and `n_var` is the number of features/variables per point in
        each trajectory.
    mdl : RegressorType
        Fitted model to use for computing the acquisition function.
    c1 : float, optional
        Weight of the contribution of the variance function, by default `1.5078`.
    c2 : float, optional
        Weight of the contribution of the distance function, by default `1.4246`.

    Returns
    -------
    array of shape (n_samples,)
        The non-myopic acquisition function computed for each trajectory in input `x`.
