"""
Example of regression with inverse distance weighting (IDW) and radial basis functions
(RBF) on a simple scalar function. This example attempts to reproduce Fig. 1 of [1].

These regression functionalities are used in the implementation of the myopic and
non-myopic solvers and are not intended to be used directly by the user.
